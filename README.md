# Decimal-Conversion
This program is for conversion of Decimal number to Binary, Hexadecimal and Binary coded decimal(BCD).
Three separate function are created for the purpose of conversion i.e
* "void decToBin(int decimalNumber, int numBit)"
* "void decToHexa(int decimalNumber)" and 
* "void decToBCD(int decimalNumber)". 

The output of conversion is stored into a output file of name "output.txt" , for that "fstream" header file is used.
